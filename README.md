# RevolutBudgeting
A MATALB tool to see statistics of your Revolut statements. 

### How to Use

Download the Revolut statements from their website in .csv form. Once you have the files you can load them in the app to see the statistics.

Once your data is loaded in the app, you can filter by selecting which account you want to see, the types of transactions you want to see and finally you can select the descriptions you want the app to use for the analysis.

The app lets you create groups to group the descriptions (each description can be in only one group at max) so that when you create Sankey diagram data (to use in https://sankeymatic.com/build/) the diagram doesn't have that many nodes and it's easier to read. You can save and load the group data, and when you load the bank data the app will automatically load saved group data if there is any.
